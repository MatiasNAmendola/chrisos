Using Flat Assembler...

Build both the BOOT.ASM and KERNEL.ASM which will create binaries (BOOT.BIN/KERNEL.BIN)
Then assemble the BUILD.ASM to create the disk image (BUILD.IMG)
The image can be loaded directly into Bochs as a floppy image or use VirtualBox (VBoxManage) to create a .vdi from the image file
